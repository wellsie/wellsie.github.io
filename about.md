# software is in my dna

Created first application at age 6; lotto number picker (BASIC, Atari-800). Found first bug several minutes later - same number could be picked twice â˜¹. In fifth grade I took my computer to school and taught my fellow students the basics of programming. Haven't stopped coding since.

Worked roles from founder, engineer, qa, evangelist, product manager to chief software architect.
